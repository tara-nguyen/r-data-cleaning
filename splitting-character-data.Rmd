```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load libraries
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

```{r}
# load students data frame
load("students.Rda")
```

```{r}
# view the head of students
head(students)
```

Provide as an extra argument to the separate() function extra ='merge'. This will ensure that middle names or two-word last names will all end up in the last_name column.

```{r}
# separate the full_name column
students <- students %>%
  separate(full_name, c('first_name','last_name'), ' ', extra='merge')
head(students)
```
